1. Ask Les what are the Adapters for our study.
2. We have Paired-ends files how different is it to run the pipeline?

3. STEP 5 removing rRNA sequences --> 2_(...).py script needed editing to work with
python 3, as SeqRecord type from Biopython is not hashable anymore, instead of set()
we used a python  dictionary.

this step cmsearch also takes a very long time, maybe we can use another software
e.g. SortMeRNA in one in SAMSA2.

4. Setting up Kaiju database issues makeDB.sh -r didn't create the kaiju_db.fmi
(possibly) too long time? Check if all the files are downloaded from RefSeq
in ./genomes folder. rerunning makeDB.sh -r --noDL -t 25. Note that
makeDB.sh must have been eddited so that -t 25 actually allow user changing
the number of threads used to extract the gz files in ./genomes

Making a database is verryyyy long the BWT part (mkbwt) seem to not work in 
parallel eventhough -n option is submitted.

5. Step 6_(...).py division range(len(sys.arg) - 5 /3) float type not compatible
with python3. Results of BWA annotation:
538 reads were mapped from mouse1_contigs.fasta
0 reads were mapped from mouse1_unassembled.fastq
Sequences mapped to 36 genes.

  !!  You can now delete files kaiju_db.bwt and kaiju_db.sa  !!

Done!
Kaiju only needs the files kaiju_db.fmi, nodes.dmp, and names.dmp.
The remaining files and the folder genomes/ can be deleted.
